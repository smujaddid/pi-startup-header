# Pi Startup Header

English | [简体中文](README.zh-CN.md)

Every time you open the Pi TUI, you are greeted by the same plain, pale block of startup text:

```
pi v0.xx.x
escape interrupt · ctrl+c/ctrl+d clear/exit · / commands · ! bash · ctrl+o more
Press ctrl+o to show full startup help and loaded resources.

Pi can explain its own features and look up its docs. Ask it how to use or extend Pi.
```

It fits Pi's signature restraint perfectly, but after a while, it can start to feel a little dull. And one day, you finally get tired of it.

## Summary

`pi-startup-header` replaces Pi's default startup header with a theme-aware gradient ASCII header.

## Install

### npm package

```bash
pi install npm:pi-startup-header
```

### Git repository

```bash
pi install git:github.com/EnderLiquid/pi-startup-header
```

## What it does

A great AI coding terminal deserves a better startup header — that is exactly what `pi-startup-header` is for.

[Pi's official website](https://pi.dev/) already leaves a strong visual impression. Why not bring some of that feeling into the terminal?

`pi-startup-header` does one thing: it replaces the default top header at session start with a Pi-style gradient ASCII logo and tagline.

By default, the logo and tagline colors come entirely from your current Pi theme, so the result stays visually consistent without any extra configuration.

From the moment Pi starts, the interface feels just a little different.

## Configuration

To globally override the header's default colors, create:

```text
~/.pi/agent/pi-startup-header.json
```

If you use a custom Pi agent directory, the configuration file is located in that directory.

Configuration file format:

```json
{
  "general": {
    "logoGradientBase": "accent",
    "textBase": "accent",
    "textHighlight": "mdLink"
  },
  "themeOverrides": [
    {
      "theme": "my-dark-theme",
      "logoGradientBase": "#7aa2f7",
      "textHighlight": "success"
    }
  ]
}
```

Each color can use one of the following value types:

- A Pi foreground `ThemeColor`, such as `"accent"`, `"mdLink"`, or `"success"`.
- A six-digit RGB hex value, such as `"#7aa2f7"`.
- An xterm 256-color palette index from `0` to `255`, such as `117`.

Each color field is resolved independently according to the following precedence:

- An override whose `theme` exactly matches the current theme name, including case, takes precedence over `general`; omitted fields inherit from `general`.
- When no override matches, values from `general` are used; omitted `general` fields inherit the built-in defaults.
- The built-in defaults use `accent` for the Logo gradient and normal tagline text, and `mdLink` for highlighted text.

Run `/reload` after editing the configuration file to apply the change. If the JSON or configuration values are invalid, the plugin shows a warning at startup and falls back to the default configuration.
